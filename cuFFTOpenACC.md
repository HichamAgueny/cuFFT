# GPU-accelerated FFT library 

# Summary

In this documentation we provide an overview on how to implement a GPU-accelerated library FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) in an OpenACC application and the serial version of the FFTW library. Here we distinguish between two GPU-based FFT libraries: cuFFT and cuFFTW. The cuFFT library is the NVIDIA-GPU based design, while cuFFTW is a porting version of the existing [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/) library. In this tutorial, both libraries will be addressed with a special focus on the implementation of the cuFFT library. Specifically, the aim of this tutorial is to:

* Show how to incorporate the FFTW library in a serial code.
* Describe how to use the cuFFTW library.
* Show how to incorporate the cuFFT library in an OpenACC application interface.
* Describe briefly how to enable cuFFT to run on OpenACC stream.
* Describe the compilation process of FFTW and cuFFT.

The implementation will be illustrated for a one-dimensional (1D) scenario and will be further described for 2D and 3D cases.

# Generality of FFT

In general, the implementation of an FFT library is based on three major steps as defined below:

- Creating plans (initialization).

- Executing plans (create a configuration of a FFT plan having a specified dimension and data type).

- Destroying plans (to free the ressources associated with the FFT plans).

These steps necessitate specifying the direction, in which the FFT algorithm should be performed: forward or backward (or also inverse of FFT), and the dimension of the problem at hands as well as the precision (i.e. double or single precision); this is in addition to the nature of the data (real or complex) to be transformed.  

In the following, we consider a one-dimensional (1D) scenario, in which the execution is specified for a double precision complex-to-complex transform plan in the forward and backward directions. The implementation is illustrated via a Fortran code. The latter can be adjusted to run calculations of a single precision as well as of real-to-real/complex transform and can be further extended to multi-dimension cases (i.e. 2D and 3D). We first start with the FFT implementation in a serial-CPU scheme and further extend it to a GPU-accelerated case.  The implementation is illustrated for a simple example of a function defined in time-domain. Here we choose a sinus function (i.e. f(t)=sin(&omega;t) with &omega; is fixed at the value 2), and its FFT should result in a peak around the value &omega;=2 in the frequency domain.  

# Implementation of FFTW   

The implementation of the FFTW library is shown below and a detailed description of the library can be found [here](https://www.fftw.org/).

As described in the code, one needs to initialize the FFT by creating plans. Executing the plans requires specifying the transform direction: *FFTWFORWARD* for the forward direction or *FFTWBACKWARD* for the backward direction (inverse FFT). These two parameters should be defined as an integer parameter. An alternative is to include the `fftw3.f` file as a header (i.e. `include "fftw3.f"`), which contains all parameters required for a general use of FFTW. In the case the file is included, the value of the direction parameter does not need to be defined.  

The arguement *FFTW_MEASURE* in the function `dfftw_plan_dft_1d` means that FFTW measures the execution time of several FFTs in order to find the optimal way to compute the FFT, which might be time-consuming. An alternative is to use *FFTW_ESTIMATE*, which builds a reasonable plan without any computation. This procedure might be less optimal (see [here](https://www.fftw.org/) for further details). 

Note that when implementing the FFTW library, the data obtained from the backward direction need to be normalized by dividing the output array by the size of the data, while those of forward direction do not. This is only valid when using the FFTW library.

To check the outcome of the result in the forward direction, one can plot the function in the frequency-domain, which should display a peak around the value &w;=+2 and -2 as the function is initially symmetric. By performing the backward FFT of the obtained function, one should obtain the initial function displayed in time-domain (i.e. sin(2t)). This checking procedure holds also when implementing a GPU version of the FFT library.

# Compilation process of FFTW

The FFTW library should be linked with fftw3 (i.e. `-lfftw3`) for the double precision, and fftw3f (i.e. `-lfftw3f`) for the single precision case. 

Here is an example of a module to be loaded. 

On Saga:
```bash
module load FFTW/3.3.9-intel-2021a
```
The same module is available on Betzy.

To compile: 
```bash
ifort -lfftw3 -o fftw.serial fftw_serial.f90
```
To execute: 
```bash
./fftw.serial
```

# Implementation of cuFFT 

We consider the same scenario as described in the previous section but this time the implementation involves the communication between a CPU-host and GPU-device by calling the cuFFT library. The cuFFT implementation is shown below. 

Similarly to the FFTW library, the implementation of the GPU-accelerated cuFFT library is conceptually based on creating plans, executing and destroying them. The difficulty here however is how to call the cuFFT library, which is written using a low-level programming model, from an OpenACC application interface. In this scenario, there are steps that are executed by the cuFFT library and other steps are executed by OpenACC kernels. Executing all these steps requires sharing data. In other words, it requires making OpenACC aware of the GPU-accelerated cuFFT library. This is done in OpenACC by specifying the directive `host_data` together with the clause `use_device(list-of-arrays)`. This combination permits to access the device address of the listed arrays in the `use_device()` clause from the [host](https://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/116711/OpenACC-API.pdf). The arrays, which should be already present on the device memory, are in turn passed to the cuFFT functions (i.e. `cufftExecZ2Z()` in our example). The output data of these functions is not normalized, and thus it requires to be normalized by dividing by the size of the array. The normalisation may be followed by the function `cufftDestroy()` to free all GPU resources associated with a cuFFT plan and destroy the internal plan data structure.

It is worth noting that the cuFFT library uses CUDA streams for an asynchronous execution, which is not the case for OpenACC. It is therefore necessary to make the cuFFT runs on OpenACC streams. This is done by calling the routine `cufftSetStream()`, which is part of the cuFFT module. The routine includes the function `acc_get_cuda_stream()`, which enables identifying the CUDA stream.

Note that the use of the OpenACC runtime routines and the cuFFT routines requires including the header lines `use openacc` and `use cufft`.

The tables below summarize the calling functions in  the case of a multi-dimension data having a simple or double complex data type (see [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk/compilers/fortran-cuda-interfaces/index.html) for more details).

# Compilation process of cuFFT

The cuFFT library is part of the CUDA toolkit, and thus it is supported by the NVIDIA-GPU compiler. Therefore, the only modules are required to be load are NVHPC and CUDA modules.
 
Modules to be loaded:
On Saga:
```bash
module load NVHPC/21.11 CUDA/11.4.1
```
On Betzy:
```bash
module load NVHPC/21.7 CUDA/11.4.1
```

We compile using the NVIDIA Fortran compiler nvfortran. The compilation process requires linking the cuFFT library (`-lcufft`) and adding the CUDA version library to the syntax of the compilation (`-cudalib=cufft`). 

```bash
nvfortran -lcufft -cudalib=cufft -acc -Minfo=accel -o cufft.acc cufft_acc.f90
```
Here the flag `-acc` enables OpenACC on NVIDIA-GPU. It is possible to specify the compute capability e.g. `-gpu=cc80` for Betzy and `-gpu=cc60` for Saga.

To run:
```bash
srun --partition=accel --gpus=1 --time=00:01:00 --account=nnXXXXX --qos=devel --mem-per-cpu=1G ./cufft.acc
```

For completeness, porting the FFTW library to cuFFTW is straightforward: it is done by replacing….  
   
For an NVIDIA GPU-based case, the linking should be provided for both cuFFT and cuFFTW libraries (i.e. `-cudalib=cufft`).

# Conclusion

In conclusion, we have provided a description on the implementation of the FFTW library in a serial code and the GPU-accelerated cuFFT targeting NVIDIA in an OpenACC application. The latter implementation illustrates the capability of calling a GPU-accelerated library written in a low-level programming model from an OpenACC application interface. Although the implementation has been done for a 1D problem, an extension to 2D and 3D scenarios is straightforward.
