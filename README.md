# Implementation of the cuFFT and FFTW libraries

This documentation is about implementing a GPU-accelerated FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) library in an OpenACC application interface, and also the FFTW library in a serial scenario. A Fortran code illustrating the implementation is provided. Details about the compilation process is described in the documentation.
